## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com)
- [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/)

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned a lot. Especially working with forms like `search input`, `select input`, and I managed to use localStorage to avoid unnecessary requests to an API

### Continued development

In the future, I want to improve this app by:

- Input state is persisted after going back from the detail page
- Search countries only in the Region that selected
- Use localStorage to get to the detail page
